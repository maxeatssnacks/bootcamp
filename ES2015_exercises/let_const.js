// Var is bound to a function, let is bound to a code block. Var can be reassigned and redeclared, Let cannot be redeclared.
    // You can access a hoisted variable with var.
// Var is bound to a function and can be reassigned or redeclared, const is bound to a code block and cannot be redeclared or reassigned.
    // You can access a hoisted variable with var.
// Let can be reassigned, const can not.
// Hoisting is what happens when you use VAR to initialize your variables. It runs them first before all of the other code is ran, which
    // can lead to some weird interactions (undefined vs non-initialized errors)
